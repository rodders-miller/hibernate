This example is based on:

http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/tutorial.html

ToDO:

- Separate out the starting of the JETTY Server into a different class
- Make the EventManager into a Model class as an interface
- Make the Servlet into a controller
	- need to work out how best to keep the hibernate session open
- Utilise Velocity to create the html page (templating)
- Use java script front end for the pages etc.

- re-implement the EventModel using Spring JPA
- Use Spring IOC to inject the model into the controller (need a factory implementation)
